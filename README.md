# Time Series Forecasting
## This project focuses on leveraging machine learning algorithms to enhance time series prediction, a critical task in various fields such as finance, healthcare, and energy management. By comparing models like ARIMA, Random Forest, LightGBM, XGBoost, and LSTM, I aim to identify the most effective techniques for accurately forecasting future trends and patterns in sequential data.

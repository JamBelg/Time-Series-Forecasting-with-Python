# Time Series Forecasting
## This project focuses on leveraging machine learning algorithms to enhance time series prediction, a critical task in various fields such as finance, healthcare, and energy management. By comparing models like ARIMA, Random Forest, LightGBM, XGBoost, and LSTM, I aim to identify the most effective techniques for accurately forecasting future trends and patterns in sequential data.

Bar chart shows a comparison of the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for different models, including Baseline, ARIMA, Random Forest, LightGBM, XGBoost, and LSTM.
Among these, the LSTM model has the lowest MAE, indicating the best performance.

# Time Series Forecasting
## This project focuses on leveraging machine learning algorithms to enhance time series prediction, a critical task in various fields such as finance, healthcare, and energy management. By comparing models like ARIMA, Random Forest, LightGBM, XGBoost, and LSTM, I aim to identify the most effective techniques for accurately forecasting future trends and patterns in sequential data. The results demonstrate that advanced machine learning models, particularly deep learning approaches like LSTM, can significantly improve prediction accuracy over traditional methods.
